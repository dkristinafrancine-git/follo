# Project Memory & Protocols

## Task Tracking Protocol
> **CRITICAL:** This protocol must be followed at the end of every task execution.

- **ALWAYS** update the global task tracker at:
  `d:\AndroidStudioProjects\follo\task_tracker.md`
  
- **When to update:**
  - After completing a feature or sub-feature.
  - Before notifying the user of completion.
  - When changing task status (e.g., from todo `[ ]` to done `[x]`).

- **How to update:**
  - Mark completed items with `[x]`.
  - Ensure the tracker reflects the *actual* state of the codebase.
  - If new tasks are discovered, add them to the appropriate section.
